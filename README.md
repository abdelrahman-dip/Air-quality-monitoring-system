In this context, the Atmega32 based air quality alert system using MQ135 sensor is an innovative project that aims to provide an early warning system for detecting harmful gases in the air. The project uses the Atmega32 microcontroller and the MQ135 sensor to monitor the air quality and alert the user in case of high levels of harmful gases. The project is designed to be simple, cost-effective, and easy to implement, making it suitable for use in homes, offices, and public spaces.
The system is based on the MQ135 sensor, which is a gas sensor that can detect various harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, and smoke. The sensor is connected to the Atmega32 microcontroller, which is programmed to read the sensor values and display them on an LCD display. The system also includes a buzzer that is activated when the gas concentration exceeds a certain threshold, and an LED that indicates the air quality level.
The Atmega32 based air quality alert system using MQ135 sensor has numerous benefits. It can help individuals and communities to monitor the air quality in their surroundings and take appropriate measures to protect themselves from harmful gases. The system can also be integrated with other environmental monitoring systems to provide a comprehensive view of the air quality in a particular area.
